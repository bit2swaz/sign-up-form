# Sign-Up Form Project
This project is a simple, visually appealing sign-up form built using HTML and CSS. It's designed to showcase modern front-end development practices, focusing on responsive layout, interactive form elements, and subtle animations, without the need for JavaScript for core functionality.

## Project Description
- This sign-up form serves as a front-end exercise to build a clean and interactive user interface. Key features include:
- Two-Column Layout: A distinct left sidebar featuring a background image and a right section for the form content.
- Form Elements: Standard input fields for user information, including validation styling for required fields.
- Interactive Design:
    - Smooth transitions for input fields on focus (blue border and subtle shadow).
    - Visual feedback for invalid input fields (red border).
    - Interactive "Create Account" button with hover and active (press) effects.
    - Subtle hover effects for links.
Modern Typography: Utilizes the 'Inter' font for clear and readable text throughout the form.
Clean Aesthetics: A polished design with appropriate spacing, shadows, and color palette.
